			Xchomp, Version 1.1
			-------------------

VERSION 1.1

-- The source code has been cleaned up.  Many variable names have been changed
   to be more descriptive.  Some comments have been added.

-- The title screen has been improved with a marble background pattern and
   shadowed letters and panels.  I'd like to thank M. Wade Barnerd for his
   ideas on this.

-- The ghost box on every maze now has a door indicating that only ghosts
   can pass through it.

-- The game can now be paused at ANY MOMENT (during death sequences, for
   example), after which it may be restarted or exited.  The setjmp() and
   longjmp() functions are used to accomplish this.

-- A bug has been fixed, in which xchomp used to pass groups of intersecting
   rectangles to XSetClipRectangles().  There is an obscure line in the
   X Window System Programming Reference which states that this action
   may lead to undefined results in the graphics output.  I received a
   message reporting that xchomp did not work on Intergraph workstations
   because of this bug.  Version 1.1 utilizes the region mechanism to
   accomplish the clipping.  No major changes in performance have been
   observed on the machines available here.

-- Some bugs have been fixed in the ghost movement logic which caused
   eaten ghosts (eyes) to circle around continuously on some levels,
   never returning to the ghost box.

-- Some other aesthetic changes have been made to the game.
